# golisp
A toy embeddable LISP evaluation engine written in Go

## Description

The purpose of this little project is to serve as a test-bed for my learning the [Go Programming Language](https://golang.org/).

As such, it is likely to be rife with areas of improvement, and feedback will be gratefully received. 

It isn't going to be particularly efficient, rigorous or complete, or perhaps even interesting. But it seemed like a fun way to get a handle on the capabilities and idiosyncracies of Go.
